some bugs:
1. tile on the tip cannot display on some area, but works after being released
2. the color of board have hidden the top surface of tiles, however 3D tiles are indeed implemented.

usage:
space 			- drop the tile (can not drop when there is collision)
ctrl + left/right 	- adjust camera
up			- rotate
a/s/w/d 		- adjust the robot arm
r  			- restart
ESC or q		- quit
