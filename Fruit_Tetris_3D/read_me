## Some remaining bugs:
* Tile on the tip cannot display on some area but works after being released.
* The color of the board have hidden the top surface of tiles. However, 3D tiles are indeed implemented.

## Usage:
* space - drop the tile (can not drop when there is collision)
* ctrl + left/right - adjust camera
* up - rotate
* a/s/w/d - adjust the robot arm
* r - restart
* ESC or q - quit
