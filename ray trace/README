Features implemented:
All features have been implemented. 
But for chessboard, I haven't implemented the feature for it to reflect the spheres. 
(I suppose only the image of board in spheres and shadows on the board are required.)

For convenience, I have defined the scene for chessboard in front of "trace.cpp".
